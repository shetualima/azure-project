Title: Heart Disease Databases

This file describes the contents of the heart-disease directory.

This directory contains 4 databases concerning heart disease diagnosis.
All attributes are numeric-valued. The data was collected from the
four following locations:

 1. Cleveland Clinic Foundation (cleveland.data)
 2. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Budapest (hungarian.data)
 3. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach, CA (long-beach-va.data)
 4. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland (switzerland.data)
Each database has the same instance format. While the databases have 76
raw attributes, only 14 of them are actually used. Thus I've taken the
liberty of making 2 copies of each database: one with all the attributes
and 1 with the 14 attributes actually used in past experiments.

The authors of the databases have requested:

  ...that any publications resulting from the use of the data include the 
  names of the principal investigator responsible for the data collection
  at each institution.  They would be:

   1. Hungarian Institute of Cardiology. Budapest: Andras Janosi, M.D.
   2. University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland: William Steinbrunn, M.D.
   3. University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland: Matthias Pfisterer, M.D.
   4. V.A. Medical Center, Long Beach and Cleveland Clinic Foundation:
  Robert Detrano, M.D., Ph.D.
